    <h1>Expanded Explanations of Patanjali Yoga Sutras</h1>

    <h2>1. योगः चित्तवृत्ति निरोधः (Yogaḥ cittavṛtti nirodhaḥ)</h2>
    <p><strong>"Yoga is the cessation of movements in the consciousness."</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This foundational sutra defines yoga as the process of calming the fluctuations and patterns of consciousness. The goal of yoga is to still the mind, enabling a state of pure awareness or self-realization.</p>

    <h2>2. तदाद्रष्टुः स्वरूपे अवस्थानम् (Tadā draṣṭuḥ svarūpe avasthānam)</h2>
    <p><strong>"Then the seer abides in his own nature."</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> When the mind is clear of disturbances, the individual's true self (the observer) can remain in its true essence without being distorted by the perceptions of the mind.</p>

    <h2>3. वृत्तिसारूप्यम् इतरत्र (Vṛttisārūpyam itaratra)</h2>
    <p><strong>"Otherwise, he is of the same form as the modifications."</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> If the mind is not controlled, the individual identifies with the mental fluctuations and perceives reality based on these modifications rather than as it truly is.</p>

    <h2>4. वृत्तयः पञ्चतय्यः क्लिष्टाऽक्लिष्टाः (Vṛttayaḥ pañcatayyaḥ kliṣṭākliṣṭāḥ)</h2>
    <p><strong>"There are five kinds of modifications of the mind, which are either afflictive or non-afflictive."</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The mind can be altered by five types of changes: correct knowledge, incorrect knowledge, imagination, sleep, and memory. These can either cause suffering or be neutral.</p>

    <h2>5. प्रमाणविपर्ययविकल्पनिद्रास्मृतयः (Pramāṇa-viparyaya-vikalpa-nidrā-smṛtayaḥ)</h2>
    <p><strong>"These modifications are correct knowledge, misconception, imagination, sleep, and memory."</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This sutra categorizes the types of thought patterns that can modify one's mental state, impacting how one perceives and interacts with the world.</p>
